The JBeret `3.1.0.Final` has been released:

- [Release v3.1.0.Final · jberet/jsr352](https://github.com/jberet/jsr352/releases/tag/3.1.0.Final)

The major change is that the `MongoRepository` and `InfinispanRepository` are moved out of the `jberet-core` and moved into its own modules, so the `jberet-core` can remove the Infinispan and MongoDB dependencies. Here is the relative pull request:
