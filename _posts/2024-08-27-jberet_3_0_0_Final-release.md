The JBeret `3.0.0.Final` has been released:

- [Release v3.0.0.Final · jberet/jsr352](https://github.com/jberet/jsr352/releases/tag/3.0.0.Final)

The major change in the Final release compared with the Beta release is that the `guava` dependency is removed from the `jberet-core`. Here is the relative PR:

This upgrade is merged into the WildFly main branch.
