Recently we have added a feature that allows users to define the database username and password in `jberet.properties` file by using environment variable. Here is an example to define the two variables:

```properties
db-user = ${DB_USER:default_user_val}
db-pass = ${DB_PASS}
```

As the example shown above, the value of `db-user` will be read from the variable name `DB_USER`. If the the `DB_USER` environment variable does not exist, the default value `default_user_val` will be used. For `db-pass`, its value will be read from the environment variable `DB_PASS`, if the variable is not set, the value of `db-pass` will be `null`.

Please note this feature only works in JBeret SE environment, because the processing logic is in the `BatchSEEnvironment` class. Because the JDBC and MongoDB repositories uses the `db-user` and `db-pass` variables to login, so it means this feature supports these two repositories currently.
